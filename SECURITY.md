### Security Reporting
If you discover a security issue or vulnerability in this repository, please follow our responsible disclosure process. Do not disclose the issue publicly until it has been addressed.

1. Report the issue immediately by creating a GitHub Issue.
2. Provide as much detail as possible about the issue, including steps to reproduce.
3. Allow reasonable time for the maintainers to investigate and address the issue.

### Security Expectations
Maintainers and contributors are expected to adhere to the following security principles:

1. Write and maintain secure code.
2. Regularly review and update dependencies for security vulnerabilities.
3. Follow best practices for authentication and authorization.
4. Protect sensitive data, both at rest and in transit.
5. Promptly address reported security issues.
6. Participate in security awareness training and follow security policies.

### Access Control
Access to this repository is controlled through GitHub's built-in access control mechanisms. Repository access levels are as follows:

1. **Contributors**: Users with write access can create branches, push code, and create pull requests.
2. **Maintainers**: Users with maintainers access have additional responsibilities for reviewing and merging code.
3. **Administrators**: Repository administrators have full access to manage repository settings.

Access is granted based on roles and responsibilities. Access should be revoked for individuals who no longer require it.

### Code Review and Approval
All code changes must go through a code review process before being merged. Key points regarding code review and approval:

1. At least one maintainer must approve code changes before merging.
2. Code reviewers should focus on security best practices during reviews.
3. Developers are encouraged to self-review their code for security issues.
4. Code reviews should include checks for common security vulnerabilities.

### Authentication and Authorization
Authentication and authorization mechanisms must be implemented and maintained to control access to the repository and its associated resources. Key considerations:

1. Use strong, secure authentication methods.
2. Limit access to sensitive resources based on roles and permissions.
3. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) where necessary.
4. Regularly audit and review access permissions.

### Sensitive Data Handling
Protecting sensitive data is critical. Ensure the following best practices are followed:

1. Avoid storing sensitive data in code, configuration files, or public repositories.
2. Use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions for sensitive information.
3. Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
4. Implement access controls for sensitive data.

### Vulnerability Management
Stay proactive in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities:

1. Regularly scan for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies.
2. Establish a process for tracking and prioritizing vulnerabilities.
3. Promptly apply security patches and updates.
4. Maintain an up-to-date inventory of dependencies.

### Incident Response
Have a well-defined incident response plan:

1. Establish a point of contact for security incidents.
2. Document procedures for incident identification, containment, eradication, and recovery.
3. Conduct post-incident reviews to improve security measures.
4. Communicate security incidents to affected parties as required by law or regulations.

### Security Awareness
Maintain a security-aware culture among contributors and maintainers:

1. Provide security training and resources to all individuals involved with the repository.
2. Encourage the reporting of security concerns and incidents.
3. Regularly review and update security policies and procedures.

### Policy Review
This security policy will be reviewed and updated regularly to adapt to changing security requirements. Contributors and maintainers are responsible for staying informed about policy changes and following the latest security guidelines.
